## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the ErrorHandler library, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: [morteza.sakiyan@gmail.com](mailto:morteza.sakiyan@gmail.com)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
4. **Environment**: Android version, library version, and other relevant details
5. **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a minimal code example demonstrating the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: We will provide a status update within 7 days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve security issues within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix is available
- We will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you

## Security Best Practices

### For Library Users

When using the ErrorHandler library:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of the library
2. **Validate Input**: Validate all user inputs before processing
3. **Handle Errors Securely**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
4. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for network communications
5. **Review Dependencies**: Regularly review and update dependencies

### Example: Secure Error Handling

```kotlin
// Good: Don't expose sensitive information
data class LoginError(
    override val message: String = "Invalid credentials", // Generic message
    val errorCode: String = "INVALID_CREDENTIALS"
) : IErrorEntity

// Bad: Exposing sensitive information
data class LoginError(
    override val message: String = "Password '${password}' is incorrect", // Exposes password
    val errorCode: String = "INVALID_CREDENTIALS"
) : IErrorEntity
```

### Example: Input Validation

```kotlin
fun handleUserInput(input: String): Result<String> {
    return try {
        // Validate input
        if (input.isBlank()) {
            return Result.failure(IllegalArgumentException("Input cannot be blank"))
        }
        
        if (input.length > MAX_INPUT_LENGTH) {
            return Result.failure(IllegalArgumentException("Input too long"))
        }
        
        // Process input
        Result.success(processInput(input))
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        val apiError = traceErrorException(e)
        // Log error securely (don't log sensitive data)
        Log.e("ErrorHandler", "Error processing input: ${apiError.errorStatus}")
        Result.failure(e)
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Network Security

- Always use HTTPS for API communications
- Implement certificate pinning for sensitive applications
- Validate SSL certificates
- Use secure network configurations

### Data Protection

- Don't log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, personal data)
- Use secure storage for sensitive data
- Implement proper data encryption
- Follow Android security best practices

### Error Information

- Don't expose internal system information in error messages
- Use generic error messages for users
- Log detailed errors securely for debugging
- Implement proper error sanitization
